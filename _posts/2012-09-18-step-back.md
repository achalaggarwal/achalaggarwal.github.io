Almost all of us, know what we *love* to do.

Some of us are still looking for it, but I am sure they'll find it soon enough.

****

For those of us who know, we are either doing that for someone else, or for our own self.

When you are busy building the next big thing, while doing what you love, you tend to look straight ahead in the tunnel with the light at the end. You see the end product and you know what you have to do. Blocking everything else out.


Before you know it, you are lost in the details to an extent that you lose sight of what you set out to do. Blinded by what you love to do. Build. Test. Iterate.

### Not necessarily a bad thing.

****

It is important to forget everything and be up close and personal to your product; but it is equally important to step back and look at the same thing from a different perspective.

The bigger picture.

It's not easy for everyone to see it. Not really sure if people around you really want to see it; are ready for it. Some would argue why is it even required.

Subconsciously, we all tend to run away from the hard things in life. We tend to pick the easy route.

### If you don't know how to ask the right questions, you won't get the right answers.

So, stop whatever you are doing, and ask yourself, why are you doing it?
