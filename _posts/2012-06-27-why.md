I thought it was time for a change from the tight claws of [wordpress](http://wordpress.org "wordpress"). I have been using it for almost 8 years on various blogs and my own site for 3 years now. Every time I want to refresh things around a bit, I goto [ThemeForest](http://themeforest.net "themeforest"), look for a cool new theme, and just go ahead and buy it. That's the best way to do it right?

### No. It is just lazy.

So, I decided to give up the "cool" WYSIWYG editor and get down with a combination of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Markdown") and [scriptogr.am](http://scriptogr.am "scriptogr.am").

The cool thing about scriptogr.am is that I don't even need to have a place to host this. This is running directly from my [dropbox](http://dropbox.com) account and is published with a single synchronize function. :)

### Updates

We all learn and read something new every single day. Looking at that, let's see how long a streak I can maintain.
